Subject : MFit version 4.2
-----------------------------------------------

Welcome to MFit 4.3 Package.

It should contain :
  mfit4   main programs
and also needs
  load    load routines, also for Mview 4.1
  funcs   fit functions
  nllsq   fit routines

This program is to be used by Matlab version 5.3 or better.

It enables graphical signal fitting with many options. Try it you'll love it !

1- Installation

  Just put those dirs into your matlab zone, and change at the beginning of
  your 'startup.m' file the lines :

libroot = '<the path to your MFit/Mview/Rescal/... toolbox>';

  Then you may have to create the MEX files 'ffind.mex', witch is used by some
  load routines. Move to the 'load' dir, and type (on terminal prompt):

mex ffind.c

  Next step is to compile the 'looktxt' program, that is also used by load routines. Just type :

gcc -O looktxt.c -o looktxt       // for Unix
gcc -O looktxt.pc -o looktxt    // for PC if you really wan't to compile it

  and to create associated MeX file:

mex -O -o looktxt texmex.c

  For PC's, the looktxt.exe program is ready to use.
  You have to move that executable 'looktxt' file to a 'bin' dir (or DOS directory for PC's). Then (on unix systems):

rehash

  Edit the file 'mfit4/mfit.ini' and modify if needed the various path names to LoadRoutines, FitFunctions and FitRoutines sections.

  Mfit is now installed. Type 'mfit' to start it.

2- Purpose, usage.

Mfit is intended to fit any data, with any function.
* You have to choose a 'load' routine:
   usually, General Load Routine is efficient. However, for special data format, it's better to use associated data importation routine.
   Load routines are quite easy to program and add to Mfit menu.
* Then, choose your fit function.
   It can be a coumpound function, thanks to 'multifunction...' (type : help multifunc)
   Parameters can be fixed when clicking on push buttons.
* Load data by clicking on 'new...' or selecting 'load' in File menu.
* Click on 'Guess' to show starting parameters for fit, or enter them manually...
* You can also select the fit routine. Gradient is fast, but can sometimes find a local minimum not really good.
   For Gradient, 'dp' (in MFit:Data/Control menu) is the partials determination step. Should not be bigger than 0.1 !!
  'stol' is the stop criteria, should be quite small (I often use 1e-5).
   Simplex is quite good if you are far away from good fit. In that case, 'stol' should be larger (about 0.1), and
   'dp' is the exploration zone around starting parameters (in percentage: 0.1 = 10 % up and down for each parameter).
   It can be large (0.5) if you really don't have any idea of fit parameter values (very far when starting).
* Click on Fit button.

Simple, isn't it ?
Just try/play with all buttons, menus, edit fields, ...

3- What's news features.

The original version of mfit ('MFIT v0.2 (c) M.Zinkin 17.5.95') was designed for Matlab 4.2
Then followed the v0.3.
It was already quite good. Anyway, some bug fixing and adds on were necessary.

Here is a list of main new features and bug fixs :

Mfit 4.0
* improved design
* official netscape help at Risoe in 'File/Help'

Mfit 4.1 : Sept 1997 (EF, DFM)
* retrieval of mfit data to matlab prompt with 'fromfit' function ('fromfit.m')
* better handling of 'Text' feature in graphic data window (removal of text with 'Delete' button)
* 'Multifunction' feature : any set of functions can be combined... very powerful.
   Force constrain on parameters or any additional matlab operation possible.
* many small bugs removed.
* sigma on params is now better... simplex uses a statistical evaluation, gradient uses jacobian.
* improved batch handling(mf_batch)
* autoguess feature installed (in data window) (11/97)
* fromfit and tomfit enable direct MFit data handling (get/set).
* autosave feature installed (before load new data, parameters are saved)
* added key accelerators and corrected some minor bugs (04/98)
* transform data feature in Mfit:Graph/Data menu(04/98)
* free/fix all params in Mfit:Graph/Data menu(04/98)
* Extensions with mf_ExecAfter{Load|Fit} objetcs(04/98)
* Links to other Applications
* MFit configuration variables can be changed by used (Links Menu)
* Change X axis now part of MFit. Called by SSym
* stuff fixing in : uplot faster, rbbox improved

Mfit 4.2 : May 1998 (EF, DFM)
* when saving MFit config file, also save startup section.
  For next start, multifunc, x axis rescaling, parameters... are rebuild.
* fit control is now in 'Option' menu of main MFit window.
* multifunc now support 'user' parameters
* a batch command field is now directly available. Press DoIt button to execute
* multifunc now saves its parameters when changing fit function
* fit parameters revert now possible
* Minor correction in ILL batch load routine, mf_rbbox
* speed up by 50 % multifunc with external temporary function (can be pre-compiled by matlab)
* zoom list is now kept when reploting (at last !) in Mfit/mf_gdata
* revised parameters uncertainty estimates in nllsq/mf_sig (EF). err=0 case corrected in mfit/mf_gdata and nllsq/mf_dfdp. ExecAfterLoad data saving in mf_gdata.

Load routines 4.1 : sept 1997 (EF, DFM)
* new batch procedures and parameters for all data formats.
* ILL load enables automatic parameters importation to rescal and mfit.
* importation of any data thanks to 'Load Routine/General Load Routine' feature ('multiload.m')
* direct user importation through 'Load/Direct Data from User' feature ('frombase.m')
* SPEC load is now better
* Revised batch routines, mf_coldg

MFit 4.3: June 2005
* adapted to Matlab 7
* improved multifunction
* added many tooltips and corrected some small bugs
* added 1D convolution tool

4- Troubles

If you find any bug please tell us.
Matlab refresh drawing might cause strange things if you are using an 'autoraise' option in your Window Manager. It causes graphics to be sometimes drawn in the wrong window (!).
The 'unix' command of matlab seems to scramble history displaying on prompt sometimes. Type '!' at matlab's prompt to fix.
