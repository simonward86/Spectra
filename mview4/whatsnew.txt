Subject : MView version 4.1
-----------------------------------------------

Welcome to MView 4.1 Package.

It should contain :
	mview4		main programs
	load		load routines, also for Mfit


This program is to be used by Matlab version 5.
However, it should mainly work with Matlab 4.2

It enables graphical signal manipulations with many options. Try it you'll love it !

1- Installation

	Just put those dirs into your matlab zone, and add at the end of your 'startup.m' file the lines :

disp('Install Matlab Graphic app : mview ');
path(path,[ matlabroot '/toolbox/local/mview4' ]);
path(path,[ matlabroot '/toolbox/local/load' ]);
colordef none

	Then you have to create the MEX files 'ffind.mex', witch is used by some load routines. Move to the 'load' dir, and type (on terminal prompt):

cmex ffind.c

	Next step is to compile the 'looktxt' program, that is also used by load routines. Just type :

gcc -O looktxt.c -o looktxt 			// for Unix
gcc -O looktxt.pc -o looktxt 		// for PC

	You have to move that executable 'looktxt' file to a 'bin' dir (or DOS directory for PC's). Then (on unix systems):

rehash

	Edit the file 'mview4/mview.ini' and modify if needed the various path names to LoadRoutines section.

	Mview is now installed. Type 'mview' to start it.

2- Purpose, usage

The object of Mview is to import many data files, and do operations between them.

3- What's news features.

The original version of mview (Des McMorrow 14.6.96) was designed for Matlab 4.2
It was addapted for Matlab 5 recently.

Mview 4.1 : Aug 1997 (DFM)
* Well, I don't really know what was new at this time.
* Anyway, many things seem to be improved.

Load routines 4.1 : sept 1997 (EF, DFM)
* new batch procedures and parameters for all data formats.
* ILL load enables automatic parameters importation to rescal and mfit.
* importation of any data thanks to 'Load Routine/General Load Routine' feature ('multiload.m')
* direct user importation through 'Load/Direct Data from User' feature ('frombase.m')

4- Troubles

If you find any bug please tell us.
Mview might sometime produce some 'warning' du to compatibility stuff. It doesn't matter...
Matlab refresh drawing might cause strange things if you are using an 'autoraise' option in your Window Manager. It causes graphics to be sometimes drawn in the wrong window (!).
The 'unix' command of matlab seems to scramble history displaying on prompt.  Type '!' at matlab's prompt to fix.
