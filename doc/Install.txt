Hello,

Well done, we are proud to present you our freeware data analysis package.
Please find History section, followed by Install and Licence sections below.
Description of each library part is supplied in each package directory, and in
HTML help pages (doc directory).

This file contains the following sections
        A- History
        B- Install procedure
        C- Licence and Contacts

Curent versions are now :
	MFit  4.3.1	
        Mview 4.2.1
	Rescal 5.1

====================================================
A- History :

====================================================	
B- Install procedure :

1- go into your Matlab or Octave directory (personal or 'root' shared). It can be obtained with the matlabroot' command under matlab.
   Usually, you should then be in something like .../matlab/toolbox/local/ 
   (I shall call it ILLROOT now)

2- uncompress with 
     'gunzip *.gz' (Unix), 'WinZip/PkZip' (for PC's) or MacGZip (Mac)
3- unarchive with (in ILLROOT)
     'tar xvf *.tar' (Unix), 'WinZip/PkZip' (for PC's) or MacGZip (Mac)
       Some directories will be created :
             mfit4, rescal5, mview4, ssym1
             funcs, nllsq, load, @spec1d
             SpectralTools, MiscTools, FileTools
       The PackList.txt file shows our local file structure, here at ILL.
4- Edit and add necessary directories into Matlab:ILLROOT/startup.m
             Our startup.m and octaverc files are provided as examples.
             In fact, you just need to modify the 'libroot' path at the begining
             of 'startup.m' file.
5- The General Load Routine (load/multibatch) uses the 'looktxt' program.
   To install it, go into the ILLROOT/load directory.
   Compiling the source:
     Under Unix/Linux:
       compile program with a command like 'cc -O -o looktxt looktxt.c'.
       Then copy the 'looktxt' executable file into your ~/bin directory, or ask
       system administrator to copy it into the /usr/local/bin/ directory.
       Note: under Unix/HP, use rather 'cc -Aa +O2 -o looktxt looktxt.c'.
       Then type from terminal prompt 'rehash', and try 'looktxt looktxt.c'.
     Under PC:
       You may have to change the Unix end-of-line characters (\n) into PC ones 
       (\n\r). This can be done with unix2dos.
       Use your standard compiler (I used MS Visual C++ 5.0 without problems).
       copy the resulting executable file 'Looktxt.exe' into C:\DOS or C:\Command.
     Under Mac:
       You may have to change the Unix end-of-line characters (\n) into Mac ones
       (\n\r).  This can be done with unix2dos.
       Use your standard compiler (I did not try this !).
   Getting pre-compiled executables:
     Our Web page <http://www.ill.fr/tas/doc/matprgs.html> provides some ready to 
     use executables.
     Copy them into ~/bin or /usr/local/bin under Unix/Linux, or into C:\Command under
     PC/Windows.

	NB : looktxt.c uses /usr/include/sys/ librairies.
	WARNING : if your compiler doesn't automatically include 'stdlib' and
             'ctype' libraries, you have to make thoses lines active in
             looktxt.c (see begining of source code).

6- To speed-up looktxt from Matlab, a Mex function 'texmex' has been written.
   It converts the normal looktxt.c into a MeX library. 
     To install it, go into the 'ILLROOT/load' directory and type 

		in load: mex -O -output looktxt texmex.c
	     
	     This can be done from Matlab or system terminal and will create 
	     a 'looktxt.mex???' file.
     Compilation into Mex file was succefull under Unix:HP-UX and SunOS systems.   
     
     IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PC USERS: The Mex file does not seem to work correctly under PC platforms
     (Windows and Linux/SuSe). I do not know why. Remove any ILLROOT/load/looktxt.dll or
     looktxt.mexlx file. The normal looktxt or looktxt.exe program will be used by Matlab (if found
     by the system !).
		
7- If you want to boost the importation of some specific data files (e.g. SPEC
    ILL and TASCOM...) you can optionally use the ffind MEX-function.
    Move to the 'ILLROOT/load' dir, and type (on terminal prompt):

		in load: mex -O ffind.c
		
   Otherwise the normal (slower) ffind.m routine is used.

8- If you plan to use the trix function (for TAS 4D-convolution through Rescal),
   you also need to create the MEX files for trix (4D neutron) routines.
        To install it, go into the 'funcs/trix' directory and type in Matlab:

		in funcs/trix: mex -O mcint.c    or    mex -O mcint2.c

        This will create a 'mcint.mex???' files.
	
9- For Mfit4, Mview4 and Rescal5, there are some .ini files that should be 
   adapted to your system (load routines, fit functions, default pathes...).
   This defines for instance the MFit and Mview menus and variables. 
	Look at the provided example files.
	Some 'whatsnew' files are provided in each archive for these programs.
