<h3>
Example 2: Reading data from a formatted data file (ILL, SPEC, RIS&Oslash;,
etc)</h3>
<font size=+1>Filters for most commonly encountered data files are available
in the MFIT/MVIEW load library. Using these filters it is possible to specify
the x and y variables, name of the column containing the errors (if it
exists), the monitor, and even a normalisation value. The <b><font color="#FF0000">loads</font>
</b>routine stores the values of these variables, so that in subsequent
calls to <b><font color="#FF0000">loads</font> </b>only the variables that
change (for example the</font>
<br><font size=+1>data file name or scan number) need to be specified.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Let us imagine that we want to load two TASCOM files from
Ris&oslash; into separate spectra, and then overplot them. The desired
x&nbsp; and y variables are OM and I, the errors are calculated from the
counting statistics, and the monitor is MON. The name of the data filter
in this case is 'tasbatch', and the data file is 'beta0007.dat'.</font>
