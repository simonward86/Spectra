Installing and Starting RESCAL for MATLAB</h2>
<b>RESCAL for MATLAB</b> requires the installation of <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MATLAB</a>
to work. If matlab is installed already then a copy of the set of programs
<b>RESCAL
for MATLAB</b> need to be ftp'ed from the main Oxford Neutron Group server
onto a working directory named "RESCAL". As this program has just been
developed a request for <b>RESCAL for MATLAB</b> should be made directly
to the e-mail address below. Once installed the program is easy to run.
Start up "matlab" in the new RESCAL directory then at the matlab prompt
simply type "rescal". Two <a href="resint.htm">parameter windows</a> will
appear into which all the spectrometer parameters can be entered. Printing
is supported for postscript laser printers but the rc_prt.m file needs
to be configured for the specific printer queue of your computer. To do
this you must edit the rc_prt.m file which creates a postscript file of
temp.ps by modifying the line <b>!print/queue=clps4_av6 temp.ps</b> to
be <b>!print_your_queue temp.ps</b>
