Resolution Methods</h2>
<b>RESCAL for MATLAB</b> offers a choice of methods for calculating the
resolution function of a neutron triple-axis spectrometer on the control
bar of the parameter window, see <a href="resint.htm">Interactive windows
and menus</a>. The choices are:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cooper-Nathans method</b> : (<i>M.J. Cooper and R. Nathans, Acta Cryst.
A29, 160-169.</i>) calculates the resolution function from angular elements
of spectrometer such as collimators, and neglect spatial effects such as
size of sample.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<b>Popovici method</b>: (<i>M. Popovici, Acta Cryst. A31, 507 (1975)</i>)
calculates resolution function including spatial effects (source, monochromator,sample,analyser
and detector shapes and dimensions), focussed monochromators and analysers,
and waveguides.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
The reason for offering a choice is that the spatial components are often
not important or are perhaps unknown. Or, phenomenological parameters for
an instrument may have been developed some time ago based on the Cooper-Nathans
method which are known to give the correct resolution widths with this
method. In other cases however spatial focussing effects play an important
role, or it may be that a focussed monochromator or analyser was used and
needs to be accounted for in the resolution calculation. For these cases
the Popovici method is used. This method is chosen by default on <a href="resinst.htm">starting
RESCAL for MATLAB</a>. Both methods use <a href="resint.htm">interactive
windows and menus</a> for entering parameters either by file or directly
with an extra window being started up for spatial parameters in the case
of the Popovici method. The Popovici method is identical with the Cooper-Nathans
method when the lateral spatial sizes such as detector width are made much
larger than the spectrometer distances and flat monochromator/analysers
are chosen. This provides a check on the two calculations. Both methods
have been tested against similar fortran implementations of the respective
methods (RESCAL at the ILL for the Cooper-Nathans method, and RESTRAX at
the ILL for the Popovici method) and are in agreement.&nbsp;
