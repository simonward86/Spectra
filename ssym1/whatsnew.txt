Subject : SSym 0.1
-----------------------------------------------

Welcome to SSym 0.1 Package.

It should contain :
	ssym1	that uses Mfit, funcs and load routines


This program is to be used by Matlab version 5.
However, it should mainly work with Matlab 4.2

It enables graphical signal manipulations for spectrum (Brillouin, Raman, ...).
Symetrizations and extraction of apparatus function are main features.

1- Installation

	Just put those dirs into your matlab zone, and add at the end of your 'startup.m' file the lines :

disp('Install Matlab Graphic app : mview ');
path(path,[ matlabroot '/toolbox/local/ssym1' ]);
colordef none

if Mfit is already installed, it's finished.

2- Purpose, usage

SSym can import data from Matlab workspace and MFit. 
If you launch SSym from Mfit, the 'ExecAfterLoad' Mfit variable is set to 
send signal to SSym after each load.

Some data files are supplied for example. 
First select 'SSym in the Links menu.
Load files with Mfit and general load routine. Select :
X: point number, Y:col1 for pmma3.0
X: col1, Y=col2 for sib42.txt
look at what's happening.
try features on it. There's no danger !
